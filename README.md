# Parsec Launcher for LibreELEC

This is a small add-on for launching Parsec on Libreelec  
Although it should be easily modifiable for other linux distributions.    

It uses the [raspbian version](https://s3.amazonaws.com/parsec-build/package/parsec-rpi.deb) of parsec provided by the [Parsec Team](https://parsecgaming.com/downloads)  

# Installation and Usage
Download the latest [release](https://github.com/skoglar/plugin.program.parsec/releases/download/v1.0.0/plugin.program.parsec.zip) on libreelec using wget, or any other method you like  
```wget https://github.com/skoglar/plugin.program.parsec/releases/download/v1.0.0/plugin.program.parsec.zip```
Then install it as any other zipped add-on and go to the addons setting
  ### First run
  When running for the first time it is absolutely necessary to set both `Email` and `Password`
