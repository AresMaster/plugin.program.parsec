# Parsec Launcher for Kodi (rpi3)

This is a small add-on for launching Parsec from Libreelec  
Although it should be easily modifiable for other linux distributions.  
It uses the [raspbian version](https://s3.amazonaws.com/parsec-build/package/parsec-rpi.deb) of parsec provided by the [Parsec Team](https://parsecgaming.com/downloads)
